## NMDC Workflow Scheduler


This module implements a job scheduling system for the NMDC workflow automation framework. It identifies candidate workflow jobs from upstream process nodes and generates executable job records for compatible and enabled workflows.
Overview

The core component is the Scheduler class, which:

    Loads and parses workflow configurations from a YAML file

    Periodically queries the database for candidate activities (WorkflowProcessNodes) that could trigger downstream workflows

    Determines whether a new job should be created (i.e., not already completed or canceled)

    Constructs and stores job definitions in a MongoDB jobs collection

    Supports dry runs, skiplists, allowlists, and forced version scheduling

This system enables robust and automatic chaining of workflows by examining upstream activities and creating jobs that meet version compatibility and data availability requirements.
Workflow

    Workflow Configuration
    The Scheduler loads a set of workflow definitions using:

self.workflows = load_workflow_configs(workflow_yaml)

### Process Node Discovery
Candidate trigger activities are identified using:

    load_workflow_process_nodes(self.db, self.workflows, allowlist)

    This function scans the database for completed upstream PlannedProcess records (like DataGeneration or WorkflowExecution), and matches them to downstream workflows defined in the YAML configuration.

    Job Creation Logic
    Each matching process node is checked to see if:

        The workflow is enabled

        A previous job already exists

        An equivalent workflow execution already exists (matching major/minor version)

    If these checks pass, the Scheduler prepares a job config including:

        Workflow WDL path, repo, version

        Input data object URLs

        Execution metadata (e.g., was_informed_by, iteration, input prefix)

        Output IDs, optionally pre-minted via NmdcRuntimeApi

    The resulting job record is inserted into MongoDB.

### Key Classes & Functions
#### Scheduler

Main orchestrator for job scheduling.

    __init__: Loads workflows, sets up API, applies force mode

    cycle(): Performs one scheduling pass

    run(): Async wrapper to run cycle() in a loop

    create_job_rec(): Constructs job records from workflow + input data

    find_new_jobs(): Finds valid job opportunities for a given WorkflowProcessNode

#### SchedulerJob

Lightweight container holding a WorkflowConfig and its triggering activity.
within_range(wf1, wf2)

Checks if two workflows are version-compatible (same major.minor version, or exact if forced).
Environment Variables
Name	Description
NMDC_WORKFLOW_YAML_FILE	Path to workflow config YAML
FORCE	If set to "1", disables version skipping logic
DRYRUN	If set to "1", jobs will not be inserted
SKIPLISTFILE	File with newline-separated activity IDs to skip
ALLOWLISTFILE	File with newline-separated process node IDs to allow
MOCK_MINT	If set, use test ID mints instead of real ones
Example

### To run the Scheduler:

python scheduler.py site_configuration.toml workflows.yaml

To dry-run the scheduler for testing:

DRYRUN=1 python scheduler.py site_configuration.toml workflows.yaml

To use specific allowlisted nodes:

ALLOWLISTFILE=my_allowlist.txt python scheduler.py site_configuration.toml workflows.yaml

Dependencies

    nmdc_automation.api.NmdcRuntimeApi

    nmdc_automation.workflow_automation.workflow_process.load_workflow_process_nodes

    MongoDB for job storage

    semver for version compatibility checking


## NMDC Workflow Process Node Loader

📚 load_workflow_process_nodes: Workflow Activity Graph Builder

This module constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of WorkflowProcessNode objects from the database by:

    Loading relevant activities (e.g. sequencing or processing records)

    Filtering and validating them based on workflow configuration

    Associating them with their input/output DataObjects

    Resolving parent-child relationships between nodes based on shared data

The result is a graph of processing activities that reflects the actual execution history and dependencies of workflows in your system.
🧠 Algorithm Overview

Inputs:
- MongoDB database handle (`db`)
- List of `WorkflowConfig` objects (`workflows`)
- Optional list of record IDs to restrict analysis (`allowlist`)

Output:
- List of fully linked `WorkflowProcessNode` objects

1. Load Required Data Objects

get_required_data_objects_map()

    Extracts and loads all DataObjects from the database that match input/output types required by the workflows.

    Builds a dictionary mapping DataObject.id → DataObject.

2. Identify Relevant Workflow Activities

get_current_workflow_process_nodes()

    Divides workflows by type:

        Data Generation (e.g., sequencing) records from data_generation_set

        Workflow Execution records from workflow_execution_set

    Queries the DB for records that match:

        The workflow’s analyte_category

        Input/output requirements (filter_input_objects and filter_output_objects)

        Version compatibility (based on major version match)

        was_informed_by links to relevant DataGeneration records

    Wraps each matched DB record as a WorkflowProcessNode

3. Associate Nodes with Their Output Data Objects

_map_nodes_to_data_objects()

    Maps each node’s output DataObjects back to the node that produced them.

    Detects and warns about duplicate data object IDs (possible data hygiene issue).

4. Resolve Parent-Child Relationships

_resolve_relationships()

    For each node, checks its inputs.

    If another node produced one of its inputs and matches an expected parent workflow, link it as the parent.

    Adds parent and children pointers to represent execution order.

✅ Result

    You get a fully connected activity graph rooted in your database's provenance data.

    Each node knows:

        Its workflow

        The data it consumed and produced

        Its immediate parent and children nodes (if applicable)

⚠️ Developer Notes

    The _within_range() version check assumes compatibility if major versions match.

    The system warns about missing data or mismatches in was_informed_by lineage.

    This logic assumes workflows have exactly one analyte category.
